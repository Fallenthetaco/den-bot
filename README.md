## Configuration Settings
The bot has a selection of configuration settings that can be changed by the server owner or a registered server admin. The full list of settings along with examples on how to use them are listed below:

  `%setconf prefix (Non-alphanumeric Character)`
  Sets the bot's prefix for your server to a given character: `%setconf prefix !`

  `setconf denpkmnonly (true | false)`
  Toggles between fetching Pok√®mon statistics from only those that can appear in Sword and Shield Max Raid Dens: `%setconf denpkmnonly true`

  `%setconf shinypkmnonly (true | false)`
  Toggles between displaying shiny Pok√®mon sprites only: `%setconf shinypkmnonly true`

  `%setconf restrictedchannels (channel-one, channel-two, etc)`
  Restricts Alcremie-B to only respond in the channels listed. Alcremie-B will respond to server admins and server owner regardless of this setting: `%setconf restrictedchannels alcremie-test, botspam`

  `%setconf adminroles (Admin Role 1, Admin Role 2, Etc.)`
  Allows specified roles to access Alcremie-B's admin only commands (setconf, showconf, resetconf, ping): `%setconf adminroles Admin Role 1, Admin Role 2`

  `%setconf pingroles (Ping Role 1, Ping Role 2, Etc.)` (Obsolete following newest Discord Update)
  Allows specified roles to be pinged by the `%ping` command: `%setconf pingroles Ping Role 1`

The following is what `%showconf` would look like after performing each of the above example commands:

```json

{
 "prefix": "!",
 "denpkmnonly": true,
 "shinypkmnonly": true,
 "restrictedchannels": [
  {
   "name": "alcremie-test",

   "id": "ID#"
  }
 ],
 "roles": {
  "adminroles": [
   {
    "name": "Admin Role 1",
    "id": "ID#"
   },
   {
    "name": "Admin Role 2",
    "id": "ID#"
   }
  ],
  "pingroles": [
    {
      "name": "Ping Role 1",
